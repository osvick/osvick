👨‍💻 About Me

I'm currently enrolled in the <strong>ALX Front-End Software Engineering Program</strong>, where I’m building core technical skills and applying them to real-world problems.

My journey into software engineering began with a curiosity for how technology transforms society and a strong desire to contribute to meaningful digital solutions. With a background in human physiology and a foundation in communication, teaching, and cybersecurity, I’m passionate about **using technology to empower others**—especially youth and underserved communities.

🧠 I thrive on self-learning, collaborative building, and improving systems that matter.  
🔥 I am particularly inspired by accessible design, education platforms, and purposeful innovation.

🎯 My Vision

To use technology and education to empower individuals and communities, making tools and knowledge accessible for everyone—especially those often left behind.

💡 What I'm Working On

I'm actively building and contributing to:

- 🔧 **Responsive front-end projects** using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind
- 🎓 **Educational tools and platforms** for students and teachers
- 🌍 **Civic-tech and community-driven tools** to drive awareness and empowerment
- ⚙️ **Open-source beginner-friendly repositories** to help others get started
